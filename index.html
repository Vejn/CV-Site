            <p>I have a Bachelor Degree in Traffic and Transportation Engineering from the University of Rijeka.
            After graduating, I have spent a year in Vancouver, B.C. on a working and travelling.
            Six years ago I moved to Berlin and here I discovered Bike Messengers.
            I have been passionate about cycling since childhood and that love for cycling didn't stop until this day.
            Working as a Bike Courier in my mid 20's felt like a dream and here I also discovered Cargo Bikes and possibilities they have, while also being fun to ride.
            I used to compete in few different cycling disciplines, and also helped organize few events.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I am also a self-taught programmer, and I started to learn to code during my time at University.
            I have stopped for some time when I moved out of Croatia, and around a year ago I decided to learn it properly.
            I am most proficient with Python, and currently I am finishing "100 days of code" Udemy course.
            I already finished one Python course on Udemy, and also recreated few classic games with help of Pygame and Kivy modules.
            I have already worked to some extent with Flask and Jinja, as well with some other popular libraries and frameworks.
            I have good understanding of HTML, Css, JavaScript and C#.
            I have some experience and good understanding of React.js and Bootstrap...
            My next goal is to further improve in C#, as I love to play with Unity.
            I have also some understanding of Java and C++, and in the future I would like to learn Rust.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Tech and Video Games are also my passion, probably because I was introduced to Super Mario and Super Nintendo when I was around 5 years old, and it stayed until today.
            I have always assembling my own PC's and at the last year of my elementary school I've built RC car out of Lego and old electro-motors.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>My hobbies are cycling, coding, gaming, game developing.
            I like also to watch movies and TV Shows.
            In my free time I also like to travel and visit festivals.</p>

          <p>Educated Bachelor of Traffic, Transportation and Logistics with combination of experience in different fields.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            My first job was student summer job when still in High School, I worked in a warehouse, commissioning and sorting orders.
            During my Student days I worked at Car Wash and various roles on several Festivals.

          <br>
          <p>
            Last six years I was working as a Bicycle Messenger where I gathered crucial experience of working in a fast paced Environment.
            I proved my self as being able to stay calm and think rational in stressful situations, as well as being reliable and punctual.
            I had a chance to take part in several Eco Friendly Projects, biggest of them being "KoMoDo".
            At "KoMoDo" I coordinated micro depot for one of the biggest parcel delivery companies in Germany.
            I was tasked to plan routes and dispatch few couriers on daily basis.
            Project was about reducing negative effect of small parcel delivery in busy areas.
            I have also took part on several test projects with mind on replacing Car and Transporter vehicles with more Eco Friendly Cargo Bikes.
